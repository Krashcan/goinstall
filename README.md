# goinstall

goinstall enables you to create binary from your go source code without going through the trouble of typing the entire gopath. 

    go get -u github.com/krashcan/goinstall
    
### Sample usage

If your main.go is in `github.com/username/projectname`, navigate to the folder and in cmd run `goinstall` like you would run any other binary file.
